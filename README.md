#Introduction

My name is Sara Farghaly, I'm Egyptian and my major is Electrical Engineering. It's been 2-years since I started to learn how to code :).
I know Python, and HTML coding language; and currently I'm in process of learning an R coding language.
besides my dream of becoming a data scientist, I am also an academic research student :), my current research topic is related to renewable energy in Photovoltaic system technology.
